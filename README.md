# Galactic Rotation Velocity Practical

## Project Overview

This project involves analyzing HI (neutral hydrogen) spectra obtained from the Tony Fairall Teaching Observatoryâ€™s sister radio telescope located in Tallarook, Australia. The primary goal is to observe and analyze the galactic plane at various longitudes, calibrate the collected spectra, and determine rotational velocities.

## Key Objectives
1. **Data Collection**: Observing the galactic plane at specific longitudes, recording spectra of hydrogen emissions around the 21 cm line.
2. **Data Stacking**: Stacking multiple observations of the same galactic longitude for a clearer signal.
3. **Calibration**: Using reference spectra to apply a brightness temperature calibration to the observed data.
4. **LSR Correction**: Correcting observed spectra for motion relative to the Local Standard of Rest (LSR).
5. **Radial Velocity Calculation**: Converting frequency data to radial velocity values.
6. **Rotation Curve Analysis**: Using the calibrated spectra to determine rotational velocities at various points along the galactic plane.

## Requirements

Install the necessary libraries using the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## File Structure
helpers.py: This file contains a set of utility functions that perform operations such as reading FITS tables, applying calibration, normalizing data, and correcting for LSR motion.
main.py: The main script where all functions are called. This script runs the complete analysis pipeline from reading observation files to producing the final stacked and calibrated spectra.
